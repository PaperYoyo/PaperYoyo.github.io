            <p>
                &emsp;Sex, more specifically prostitution and pornography, isn't something that has been in the
                United States for a short period of time but has been around since the early 1800s and maybe
                most likely before then and the realm it has existed has changed many times as well as the regulations
                and acceptance of it in public and social spheres.

            <p>
                &emsp;Prostitution has most likely been apart of United State history from the beginning, the trade of sex
                for something in return. With this it was probably only kept to undergroundish activity out of the very
                public eye and was something not very glorious. <br>
                &emsp;Martial law was declared in memphis to help combat the rise of venereal disease during war time
                by temporarily making prostitution legal and requiring prostitutes undergo health checks and treatments with a fee
                to obtain a certification to be a prostitute. Starting in 1870 prostitution was seen as a way to
                decrease crime and increase happiness as well as decrease disease in St. Louis. That year it was made legal with requirements by the
                state for check and registration of the prostitutes to make it a job for them. Just for years later however
                it was criminalized again. During this time New York from 1868 to 1877 was going though bill after bill
                to accomplish this same task with much difficulty. Since these times Prostitution has always mostly been kept
                in the illegal status with some exceptions here and there such as Nevada in present day.

        <div class="main_card" id="Porn" role="article">
            <h1>Pornography</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;Starting with a good definition of pornography is something that is important here because even
                the american government had a hard time defining it. With this it will also take into account that what
                is considered to be obscene also changes without any connection to what is considered to be porn or erotic
                material. The definition that can be used that fits the system the government sets up is erotic material
                that is specifically designed to cause arousal. With the definition of erotic material being pretty stand still
                and the definition of obscene material changing this definition doesn't use either but calls importance to the
                intention and result of the created material.<br>
                &emsp;With pornography being able to be created, at least under this definition, as soon as "pen could be put
                to paper" identifying the first pornographic material would be all but impossible, however a painting at
                the proper time did help define the boundaries. This painting however not exactly being porn did show
                and expression of sexuality in the 1840s that was not look upon fondly by the American public. With this social
                backlash nothing really happened until after the civil war, 1860s, which culture did push for more obscene materials.<br>
                &emsp;As times continued to change the people changed as well. This can be seen with the content of the entertainment
                that was being provided at the time. During the 1920s advertisements for things such as TVs, radios, cars, and phones
                were using sex to pull more customers showing a more luxurious lifestyle. This wasn't just the case for advertisements
                but for TV and movies as well with movie titles like "A Shocking Night," "Luring Lips," "Red Hot Romance," and
                "Her Purchase Price." <br>
                &emsp;With the turn of WWII the people were in need of some release from the war and pornography was that item.
                Daily things were coming out, weather it be media, advertisements, or entertainment. Much of it was directed towards men
                in a way that objectified sex and especially women. This was the culmination of what was called the "paperback
                revolution," which started with pocket sized books being sold in drugstores and newsstands in the late 1930s.
                Full blown magazines for everyone started coming out such as the Confidential, Keyhole, The African Queen, and
                most notably Playboy. With this revolution by the mid 1950s it was estimated that this business profits
                were a couple hundred million dollars a year to one billion dollars a year. And in the mid 1950s the
                House of Representatives is noted as saying that pornography had "moved from the dark side street into the most
                respectable neighborhoods and establishments in the community." <br>

        <div class="main_card" id="Rules and Regulations" role="article">
            <h1>Rules on Porn</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; Through out the existence of pornography and prostitution there has been those that support it
                and those that wanted to get rid of it. Groups such as feminists, Women's Christian Temperance Movement,
                Legion of Decency, National Organization of Decent Literature, and clergy men all at some point, if
                not their entire existence, fighting to reduce and in some cases rectify, by helping those apart of,
                pornography and prostitution. Even with the number of groups fighting against it thought out time
                these activities, mostly pornography, have grown and become more accepted by society. Without a large push,
                except in select cases, society seemed to keep falling towards pornography and prostitution as a way
                to let go from the thing around them. This can be seen after every major conflict the US was apart of
                the rise in these materials and even the legalization of prostitution during these times for soldiers
                of the military. <br>
                &emsp; Those that did push for more expression of sexual behavior however did exist and the implication
                can be made that with the increase of sexual expression the increase of pornography and prostitution would
                soon follow as an act upon what the public was expressing. One such person would be Margret Sanger
                with her desires to spread awareness and use of birth control and freedom of women's sexuality. Even though
                she didn't advocate for more pornography or prostitution the ability to decrease the risk of pregnancy after
                sex is something that until birth control the prostitution business uses abortions to solve. Another factor
                would have been Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey report showing how sexual America's habits were behind closed
                doors. This exposure to America's sexuality in the shadows prompted more open exploration of sexuality
                in society. Two groups do come to the for front when talking about socialized sex and that would be the gay and
                bohemian community. Sexuality with these two communities are intertwined to some of the most core aspects of them
                and this is expressed on how they present themselves to society. This presentation of intertwined sex into their
                subcultures also pushed people to be more accepted of a sexualized society. <br>
                &emsp; Even with social pushes one way or another the government still makes the final decision on what is
                the law of the land and what is accepted legally in society. When it comes to obscenity laws the early 1900s
                the basis of all the laws we see today come forth everything else becomes industry regulated or case law from
                the supreme court. Examples of this would be the 1907 chicago censorship laws for films to regulate what would come
                to the silver screen then prompting a third party group start rating movies and then the hollywood industry taking
                over in the mid 1900s. Case laws to be looked at for obscenity would include Queen v Hicklin brought forth
                an obscenity test that would then be used from the 1930s forward. Eventually this case law lost all power
                by the Roth decision in mid 1950s when obscene was separated from sexual. This decision neither endorsed
                or restricted pornography but allowed many more books to come out of hollywood that would be considered as such.

        <h1>Thankyou</h1>
        <p>I do want to take this time to thank you for this class and allowing a almost completely centered discussion on
        the history of sexuality in society. This I think is one of the best classes I have taken in terms of allowed discussion.
        This class is not how I thought it would go and I am extremely glad. <br>
        Thankyou. <br>
        I do want to apologized because I am not able to clean up this page as much as I would normally like to because I have work
        later to day. I did however try to put all the information that I wanted to but wasn't able to get the styling I would have liked
        to of presented. <br>
        Thankyou for taking your time to work with me and talk through some things at the end of the semester.</p>
